                <p>1) This CAD model outlines the basic shape and functionality of the exterior frame of the Brewista. The idea is to have the top and front plates on a hinge for easy access to components for installation and maintenance. There is also a back door for access to electronics.</p>
                <p>2) The material is standard plywood of half-inch thickness. The two side plates rest on top of the bottom plate, and the top plate rests on top of the side plates. This is to maintain structural integrity, and to make sure the screws holding the components in place are carrying as little weight as possible.</p>

                <p>1) The cup holders went through several iterations, both for space reduction and print time optimization. This final version has the four holders for the reservoirs lined up in an arc so that they are of equal distance to the main filling area. The walls of the cup holders go up two inches, which is just under half the height of the reservoirs.</p>
                <p>2) The jagged pattern featured on the floor of the model was originally a large rectangle that filled the space of the Brewista floor. However, this was inefficient. Thus, the unnecessary space was removed, while still maintaining the corners at the tips of the “U” shape to make sure the model lies snug in the corners of the Brewista.</p>
